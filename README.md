# uni's number theory 

Hello, welcome to one of my first python projects.  I wanted to prove a theory I had in my head for a long time.  I may not be the first to prove or come up with this idea.

The theory goes like this.

**Any postive integer squared will be 1 integer greater than the product of integer+1 and integer-1.**

For example let's use 4.

`4*4 = 16`

`3*5 = 15`

Therefore the theory is proven for 4.  The code can prove the theory up to any integer.
